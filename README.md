# TheMazeOfWaze.Ex2


This project represents a 5 main classes: NodeData, edge, DGraph, Graph_Algo and graphGUI.

The main purpose of this project is to build any directed graph using the Nodes and the edges.

*****NodeData***** :- its interface is node_data and it represents the set of operations applicable on a 
  node (vertex) in a (directional) weighted graph.
  
 ****edge**** :- its interface is edge_data and it represents the set of operations applicable on a 
  directional edge(src,dest) in a (directional) weighted graph.
  
  ****DGgraph**** :- its interface is graph and it represents a directional weighted graph.
  The interface has a road-system or communication network in mind - and should support a large number of nodes (over 100,000).
  The implementation should be based on an efficient compact representation ( NOT be based on a n*n matrix).
  
  ****graphGUI**** :- use it to draw the graph we build .
 for example her are some graphs :
